# Case-Study-2

The dataset(csv) contains columns with 3 years worth of customer orders. There are 4 columns in the csv dataset: index, CUSTOMER_EMAIL(unique identifier as hash), Net_Revenue, and Year.

For each year I calculated the following information:
•	Total revenue for the current year
•	New Customer Revenue e.g. new customers not present in previous year only
•	Existing Customer Growth. To calculate this, used the Revenue of existing customers for current year –(minus) Revenue of existing customers from the previous year
•	Revenue lost from attrition
•	Existing Customer Revenue Current Year
•	Existing Customer Revenue Prior Year
•	Total Customers Current Year
•	Total Customers Previous Year
•	New Customers
•	Lost Customers

Additionally, generated a few unique plots highlighting some information from the dataset.
